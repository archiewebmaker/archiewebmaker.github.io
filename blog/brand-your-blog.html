<p class="py-3">Creating a branded website or blog can be the best thing you do for your business. <strong>But why branding is so important?</strong> Building a brand isn't about feeding your ego. It's about giving yourself more opportunities to help and connect with people in your industry. Branding is important because not only is it what makes a memorable impression on consumers but it allows your customers and clients to know what to expect from your company.</p>

<p>Your brand is not a direct ranking factor in Google. With that being said, users tend to prefer brands; they're more likely to click on a link from a brand that they know and trust. Even if you earn the top spot for every query you want, if people hate your brand, they won't click on your website in their search results.</p> 

<p>And if they don't click on your website, they won't buy your product or service. All of your efforts to work with search engines will have been a waste of time.</p>

<h4>A Brand Communicates Your Company's Story</h4>
<p>A brand lets people know who you are and what you do. Branding can help you figure out what and how to communicate your company's story. It is a way of distinguishing yourself from the competitors and clarifying what it is you offer that makes you the better choice. Readers new to your site will only stay if you make it easy. If they have to think then they'll leave. If they're confused they'll leave.</p>

<p>Most people determine whether to stay on or leave a site in the first few seconds. If you want your blog's visitors to stay for longer and read your content, you need your site to leave a great first impression. Your site needs to look elegant, be easy to navigate, and show off useful and informative content.</p>

<p>Every company needs a website, but the really successful sites are usually well branded. Make no mistake about it: a recognizable and loved brand is one of the most valuable assets a company owns. According to a Nielson survey, 59% of consumers prefer to buy new products from brands familiar to them.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, a visitor lands on your brand’s website. He finds it legit and gets impressed by the unique yet simple design of the website. He makes a quick decision to buy from your brand and goes on recommending it to his friends and family.</p>

<p>To make this happen in the real world, we need to put lots of effort and care into brand building with your website design. Infusing branding strategies into the web design will indeed help develop trust among the users.</p>

<h4 class="section-title">What's The Difference Between a Personal Blog and a Business Blog?</h4>
<p>It's the <strong>branding</strong>. While a business blog will become an extension of the brand itself, a personal blog will have no such direction to follow, at least in the beginning. However, what's stopping you from taking an organized approach to building a long-lasting brand for your blog?</p>
<p>Does your brand stand out? Whether it's your domain name, logo, company colors, voice, look and feel, use of language, sounds or other attributes – does it make a strong impression? To ensure that your brand creates a lasting impression, you must be able to distinguish it from your competitive set in a way that’s meaningful and memorable to your customers.</p>
<p>By having a clear branded blog, readers will know what to expect. If they like what you do, they’ll stick around. They may even subscribe to your email list.</p>

<h4 class="section-title py-3">Branding can be broken down into three phases:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> Strategy</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> Identity</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> Marketing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brand Strategy</strong> will map out how you are different, trustworthy, memorable and likable by your ideal customer. It will convey your purpose, promises, and how you solve problems for people.</p>

<p><strong>Brand Identity</strong> is the way that you convey this to the public with visuals, messaging, and experience. Your brand strategy will influence how you present your identity and align it with your purpose for the most impact.</p>

<p><strong>Brand Marketing</strong> is the way that businesses or organizations highlight and bring awareness to products or services by connecting values and voice to the right audience through strategic communication.</p>

<h4>A point to be noted</h4>
<p><strong>Color psychology</strong> is definitely not a myth, and marketers and advertisers have been using it to evoke the feelings in us, which they intend for a brand's recognition.</p>

<p>For instance, the color green is calm and represents health and nature. It is used by healthcare and environment-friendly brands. Blue depicts intelligence and responsibility, and numerous corporate brands use this color very frequently in all aspects to encourage client trust.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>A <strong>branding</strong> project can help you figure out what and how to communicate your company's story. Do you need some help determining your <strong>brand</strong>'s mission, vision, and overall business and marketing goals? Or perhaps naming your company or coming up with the tagline?</p>

<p>These exercises fall into the <strong>brand</strong> identity category, and it's something a <strong>skilled branding agency</strong> like ours can help you with. Or, something you can do with your internal team during a brainstorming session.</p>

<p>But no matter whom you <a href="/page/contact.html">choose to work with</a>, <strong>branding</strong> your website and blog is a vital part of your business that will help you both understand and communicate who you are.</p>

<p>From the people's view, you are always a brand, whether you think you have one or not. And your website design speaks volumes about your brand. The main reason brands are developed is to help build trust among the customers. Achieving the same via your website design is not very difficult.</p>
<p>All the best <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>.</p>
