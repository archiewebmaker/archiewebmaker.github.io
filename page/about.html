<h3 class="text-center">Some Romantic Moments of My Life</h3> 

<p class="mb-4 py-3">Based on a true story...</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-3">I have to form myself, as I have never really formed before.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-3">You may say I betrayed him, but for me, it was one of the best things ever happened to me.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-3">He was an alpha from Nazareth, but what good can come from Nazareth, right? And I suppose that it is always a little difficult for Nazarene to understand one another properly.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-3">I owe more to him than anyone else in the world, and my association with him is the one romantic incident of my life.

<p class="mb-4 py-3">But I had to leave him as I need to pen down this sweet little romantic story of our lives...</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Khrsssh!</h4>

<p class="mb-4 py-3">Oops! I am so sorry. I didn't notice you are here. People hardly come to visit my place.</p> 

<p class="mb-4 py-3">Hello, nice to meet you. This blog is sweat and tears of a man, a beloved husband, and a father of two angels who live far away to the east, the like of which you may not find in your world today. </p>

<p class="mb-4"> He created his first "Hello World" page in 1998 using <strong>Microsoft Frontpage</strong>. After he built his first website on <strong>Geocities</strong> and getting instant attention from others, he decided to pursue a career in his passion.</p>


<p class="mb-4">He got introduced to blogging in 2004 and eventually published his first blog in New Delhi called "www.greports.com" - a blog about Northeast India's current affair.</p>

<p class="mb-4">There's something about his passion, and perhaps his writing too that often left me battered. English is not his first language, but he loved it because it empowered him to express his thought in every way he could imagine.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">After getting the opportunity in 2011 to design and publish the first website of Trinity Theological College for free, he decided to turn it into a full business.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Since then, he has been providing the resources and services to educational institutes, professionals, and businesses. He wanted to share his experiences with a larger audience on how to become successful in life. But sorry to be such a spoiler - his business was taken over by Archie Webmaker - that's me, though a pen name.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I come to work every day because I want to solve problems and make the internet more beautiful. We live in a world of too much information. Too much advice and too little insight, and so I candidly shepherd aspiring entrepreneurs through business ideas, building brand, marketing, and everything else that matters in this blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Wait for a second...</p>
