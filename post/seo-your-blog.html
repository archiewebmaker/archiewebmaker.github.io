<p class="mb-4 py-4">SEO has changed.</p>
<p class="mb-4">And we must change. Allow me to speak my mind today.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Do you think Wikipedia, one of the top ranking websites give a shit about SEO?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Almost all amateur bloggers spend all their day on SEO or link buildings instead of marketing. But the irony is, they all want to make money.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We all know SEO or Search Engine Optimization is a long-term strategy. So long as there's a web, link will matter. There's no doubt about it.</p>

<p class="mb-4">But ask this yourself. Do you think you can simply beat your competitors on the search result page who are ahead of you by 10-20 years by following some SEO techniques?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Don't you think they are most probably following the best SEO practices to beat their own competitors?</p>

<p class="mb-4">I think it's about time to stop listening to those SEO experts who want your business and start focusing on your business.</p>

<h4>The Right SEO Approach</h4>
<p class="mb-4">The right SEO approach is to tell the search engine what is your site is all about in all clearity and honesty.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Don't try to manipulate or game the system. You will only get penalized which is bad for your business.</p>

<h4>SEO Your Image</h4>
<p class="mb-4">SEOing your image for the search engine is a good SEO practice - giving relevant titles and ALT text for your images.</p>
<p class="mb-4">But let me ask you this.</p>
<p class="mb-4">What does it benefit you from such traffic?</p>
<p class="mb-4">Most of them only want to download copyrighted images.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As for me and my site, they are unwelcomed guests.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I take pride in my work. And I have a clear defined target audience.</p>

<h4>Building Backlinks</h4>
<p class="mb-4">A backlink is a link created when one website links to another. Backlinks are also called "inbound links" or "incoming links." Backlinks are important to SEO. We hear this all the time.</p>

<p class="mb-4">That's why most amateur bloggers are dropping their links almost everywhere and anywhere they can. Quora has become the ultimate platform for dropping links.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Dropping links on social platforms only tell your desperate story.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Do you know the reason why most people don't dislike links to Wikipedia pages as much as it is to your blog?</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you need a backlink, just ask a site for a backlink.</p>

<p class="mb-4">All you need to do is create a backlink request that is impossible to ignore or turn down.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Understand what site owners are looking for. That's it!</p>

<h4>XML Sitemap Still Matters</h4>
<p class="mb-4">A sitemap may not affect the actual rankings of your web pages. Sitemaps are like an aid – a guide that gives more information about your site to Google, such as making sure that all of your URLs are indexed for easy crawling.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you're not already using the Google XML Sitemaps generator on your WordPress site, you should install it now. There's no guarantee that your rankings will improve. But, it will help Google discover your fresh content faster.</p>

<h4>Use Your Keywords in the Title and Subheadings</h4>

<p class="mb-4">There's some correlation between keywords in the title tag and Google rankings.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Alongside, I recommend you use your primary keyword and its different variation in your content’s heading tags as well.</p>

<p class="mb-4">But don't stuff your keywords in an attempt to manipulate your site’s ranking because that can have a negative impact.</p>

<p class="mb-4">There are a few things that you need to keep in mind while writing an SEO title and meta description for your post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't let your title and description cut off in Google. You want the searcher to get the complete idea of what your content is about.</li>
<li>Add your keyword in the title and description.</li> 
<li>Never stuff keywords – make sure your writing sounds natural.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">Bear in mind that for the title, you only have 55 characters, so you need to give it some thought before you write it.</p>

<h4>Focus On Long Tail Keywords</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Long Tail keywords are three or four phrase keywords that are very specific to what you're selling. They are generally easy to rank because of their low competition.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Whenever your potential blog reader uses a highly specific search phrase on Google, they tend to know exactly what they’re looking for. And if you can create content that matches that search intent, you’ll be sure to rank high!</p>

<p class="mb-4">You need to use these keywords in the right places on your content, for example, in title, description, and subheadings of your content.</p>

<h4>The Essential Meta Tags</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Meta tags are HTML tags that appear in between the opening and closing <head> tags. They’re used to show preview snippets for a specific webpage in the search results. They feature meta keyword phrases.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Even though Google doesn’t use the keywords meta tag in page rankings, meta keyword descriptions are still relevant and it makes sense to spend time on them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Meta tags will also make your search results attractive, which can attract more clicks from search engine users feeling your website has the high-quality content filling their needs.</p>

<p>&lt;!--  Essential META Tags --&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;European Travel Destinations&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;Offering tour packages for individuals or groups.&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;http://euro-travel-example.com/thumbnail.jpg&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;http://euro-travel-example.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary_large_image&quot;&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;!--  Non-Essential, But Recommended --&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;meta property=&quot;og:site_name&quot; content=&quot;European Travel, Inc.&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:image:alt&quot; content=&quot;Alt text for image&quot;&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;!--  Non-Essential, But Required for Analytics --&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;meta property=&quot;fb:app_id&quot; content=&quot;your_app_id&quot; /&gt;<br />
  &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@website-username&quot;&gt;</p>
  

<p class="mb-4">Lastly, SEO is a long-term practice. If you’re desperate to rank in Google’s top 10 overnight or a few months after starting your blog, you’re making a very big mistake with your website.</p>
