<p class="py-3">The internet is full of great articles about blogging, including how to BUILD a successful blog. </p>
<p>Maybe this will become one of them, whatever.</p>
<p>However, this piece is different.</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>If you have been harboring this wonderful desire to start a blog and make a living blogging, let me tell you this: </p>
<p>This is the perfect time to decide not to host your blog, not now.</p>
<p>I want you to take that decision, seriously.</p>
<p>With my proven method, you can even start marketing right away from day one! I assure you, whoever you are, wherever you are from, you will be blessed by following this proven method - it will make all the difference for you.</p>
<p>I give you my word.</p>
<p>So, I want you to relax. Take a deep breath, this is going to take a bit.</p>

<p class="intro py-4">For the past many years, we have been doing it all wrong. Actually, we have been duped. You got to stop listening to those affiliate marketers who want you to click on their referral link to host your website or blog right away. That's all they want. None of them is giving you the right advice. If building a succesful website or blog, one that generates substantial income, is going to take months or even years, <strong>why go for paid hosting now?</strong></p>

<p>The moment you pay for your hosting, the clock starts ticking nonstop for the next billing. Most beginners wasted so much time in building their website or blog (including SEO) after going online instead of marketing.</p> 
<div class="section-clock text-center">
<img class="img-fluid" src="../images/clock-ticking.gif" alt="Hosting Clock Tower">
</div>
<p>So when the time comes for the next hosting bills, they had to decline because they made no money from their website or blog. And they finally quit.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
<p class="shadow p-3 rounded"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> If you want to start a successful website or blog, you got to build it first. Paid hosting your website or blog online comes later.  <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
<footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite class="small" title="Archie Webmaker">Archie Webmaker</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="py-3">To go Self-hosting or Not?</h4>
<p>Majority of the affiliate marketers will tell you to go self-hosting and start a WordPress site. I am not saying they are wrong. But majority of beginners had failed, and that's a fact. Most bloggers start a blog, push out a few posts based on something that they love, slap on a few Google Ads and believe that they will get loads of traffic and earn bags and bags of money. Sorry to be such a spoiler but that's not how it works.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the only person visiting your blog may be you. It takes months or even years to grow loyal audience. So why spend thousands of money on paid hosting now?</p>

<h5>SEO Has Changed</h5>
<p><strong>And we must change.</strong> We all know SEO or Search Engine Optimization is a long-term strategy. It may take days, weeks or months for Google to crawl your website or blog. But it will take years to be on the top Search Engine Result Page (SERP), provided you followed the best SEO practices.</p>

<h5 class="py-3">The Right SEO Approach</h5>

<p>Hummingbird is the name of the update that introduced semantic search, Google's way of deciphering user intent rather than mapping out individual keywords and phrases.</p>

<p>Today, Google attempts to understand meaning rather than matching keywords, so keyword-centric optimization doesn't work the same way. However, keyword research is still relevant, as it can help guide your strategic focus and provide you with ranking opportunities.</p>

<p>The right SEO approach is to tell the search engine what's your site all about in all clearity and honesty. Don't try to manipulate or game the system. You will only get penalized which is bad for your business.</p>

<p>Ask this yourself. Do you think you can simply beat your competitors on the search result page who are ahead of you by 10-20 years by following some SEO techniques? Don't you think they are most probably following the best SEO practices to beat their own competitors?</p>

<p>I think it's about time to stop listening to those SEO experts who want your business and start focusing on your business.</p>

<h4>Build Your Blog</h4>
<p>You can't win the internet in just one year! Your goal should be set for 5-10 years. Starting a business from scratch doesn't have to be hard or complicated, but it does take planning, work and time. You got to love the process.</p>

<p>You need to build your blog like you build a castle right from your computer locally. Only when your blog is ready with all the bells and whistles, start your blog. And that's the way it is. For example, if you are planning to sell courses on your blog, have all the course materials ready before you start your blog.</p>

<p>Do you know you can install a website or a WordPress blog on your computer? And here's the best tool to get you started. Install the free <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">xampp server</a> to host a website or build a WordPress blog locally on your computer. And prepare all your works there. You can use it for building, branding, customizing and testing purposes. Once you finish them, you can easily export them from your local blog to your blog online. </p>

<p>With this method you are taking your blog to the next level even before you start. Why not take a milestone ahead, make yourself stand-out and be stronger even before you start. And here's the best part - it gives you the freedom to start marketing and start selling right away from day one.</p>

<h4>In the Beginning</h4>

<p>In the beginning, the only person visiting your blog may be you. It takes months or even years to grow loyal audience.  So why spend thousands of money on paid hosting now?</p>


<p>Focus more on your brand recognition than selling your products. To get started, you don't need a self-hosted website or blog. But better build a branded site with a <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9156104-11429042" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">custom domain name</a> on a reliable free hosting site like <strong>Github</strong> Page.</p>

<p>Github is a reputed community for developers owned by <strong>Microsoft</strong>. It's so easy to build a website or blog on Github Page. <strong>GitHub Pages </strong>sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month. Think positive, this bandwidth limitation set by Github is good for you. You can now make use of it to target specific people important to your business - perhaps potential clients only.</p>

<h4 class="py-3">What You Need To Do Now</h4>
<ul>
<li>Buy a <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9156104-11429042" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">custom domain name</a> from NameCheap for as low as $8.88.</li>
<li>Set up a free account on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Page</a>.</li>
<li>Add Your Domain Name to your Github Page.</li>
<li>Build a <a href="/blog/brand-your-blog.html">branded website or blog</a>.</li>
<li>Start promoting your Brand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a custom domain and a branded website tells your audience that you are serious and you mean business (you only invest $8.88).  What you can do now is create epic posts or contents and start sharing on social media. The secret is not in creating many contents but in sharing your epic posts or contents again and again until millions and millions read them.</p>

<h4>Build Your Community</h4>
<p>This part will require a lot of focus. You have to create your following. After all, that's where the bulk of your success will come from. In order to create a following, you have to create conversations. You have to join every conversation surrounding your topic. Google your topic, and see what is being said about your topic, and by whom, and then join in the conversations and reach out. Make yourself prominent in the eyes of your target audience.</p>

<p>Build a community around your brand. You can make use of the social media pages and groups and most importantly maintaining a <strong>Youtube channel</strong> is vital to your business success. Without people liking and following your brand, it's almost impossible to grow a business. To build the reputation it needs, you need to be an expert in your niche. Start giving free valuable guides and advices. In doing so, you eventually earn the authority and reputation in that particular niche or market. But it all begins with <strong>branding!</strong></p> 

<div class="text-center py-3"><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/blog/brand-your-blog.html">Why you should brand your blog...</a></div>

<p>When working for a company, you help the company and its owners' personal brand getting recognition. You can only achieve considerable fame and success if you have your own personal brand which means you need to start your own business. Everyone knows the founders of a company, no one knows the workers. Developing your personal brand is the key to monetizing your passion online, whether you're delivering your content through videos or a blog.</p>

<h4>Monetizing Strategy</h4>
<p>Depending on the type of blog you have, you can create a specific monetizing strategy. If you're building a finely niched blog, you shouldn't focus on ads in the beginning &mdash; people frown upon ads. You should focus on building a Brand.</p>
<p>When you build a brand, you start attracting readers.</p>
<p>Once you've built a loyal readership, you can start implementing your monetizing strategies. Your main target is to implement Sales Funnels. How does it work?</p>

<ul>
<li>You write posts that attract specific people who are your target audience.</li>
<li>They read your posts and sign up to a highly related offer to receive newsletters from you.</li>
<li>These people aren't ready to buy yet, but are extremely engaged with your content.</li>
<li>They finally purchase your product.</li>
<li>They love it so much, that they become loyal customers and buy more products from you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now imagine several people moving through this funnel.</p>
<p>This is the basic principle of how most Bloggers make money and what you need to aim for.</p>
<p>Google has been telling us for years to set up goals and funnels for free at Google Analytics. You probably missed this out because most affiliate marketers wouldn't tell you this.</p>

<p class="py-3">I want you to check this video out, please don't skip. Remember, this is what most bloggers failed to do.</p>

<h4>Conslusion</h4>
<p>Only after getting the recognition you need - enough number of readers, subscribers or followers, opt for self-hosting with the ulimited plan. When you reach this stage, you can literally sell anthing you want and be successful. You can make this happen in 3-5 years. So don't quit on the way.</p>

<p>This is the best, affordable and the ideal way. In reality, <strong>even if you lose</strong>, you lose only $8.88 and not $1000+.</p>

<p>Success is no accident. Living a great Dotcom lifestyle will not come by luck or chance. It won't fall from the sky. There's no magic wand. There's no quick fix. The good news is, there are principles that lead to success. And I have already shown you. If you commit to doing the things successful people do, you will live a life of success and happiness.</p>
