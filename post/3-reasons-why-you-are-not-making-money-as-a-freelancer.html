<p class="mb-4 py-4">I hate to break it to you, but working freelance means working.  The reality is that work will not come to you like someone who has a crush on you.  You have to fight for it and fight hard. </p>

<p class="mb-4">When I started freelancing, I was so broke I struggled to buy ice cream for my kids. But now, I am less freelancing and can earn a full-time income from freelancing. Freelancing is not about getting lots of clients but getting the right client.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you're not making money as a freelancer, it is your fault. The good news is that this is a fixable issue, and if you decide to put in the work, you can change the situation around very quickly.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Here's why you're not making money as a freelancer and some quick and easy ways to fix it.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">You are Searching for Clients in the Wrong Place</h4>
<p class="mb-4">If you are finding that the clients you are attracting aren't the ones you were hoping to work with, you might be looking for clients in the wrong place. Identifying your ideal customer can seem like an overwhelming and daunting task. What jobs do you enjoy the most? What industry do you prefer the most?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Don't think of getting many clients because you are not a robot. You can't work for a million people in a month - not even a hundred. Instead, you need to <a href="/post/how-to-price-yourself-freelancer.html">pay attention to your price</a> seriously.</p>

<p class="mb-4">And taking on projects beyond your area of expertise is only going to cause you unnecessary and easily avoidable stress. I'm an experienced WordPress developer, but that doesn't mean I'll work on every single WordPress project that comes my way. I'll work only with those I know I can complete with extreme efficiency - custom design and user experience.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">You're Relying on Websites such as Fiverr and Upwork</h4>

<p class="mb-4">If you're relying on these sorts of freelancer websites to get work, you're missing out big time. If you're serious about making a decent income, you'll need to dump those websites with the low-paying clientele and get serious about learning how to find and pitch clients directly.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you want to build a career and catch the big fish, you'll need to ditch those websites and start reaching out to editors and content managers directly.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Pitching is everything. How did I do it? You have to identify a client's need before you even reach out to them, offer them advice for free, and make a personal connection.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">You're Not Marketing</h4>
<p class="mb-4">If you're a new freelancer with little work or no work, you have to put every hour of freelancing time into marketing. That is all you should be doing every day for as many hours as you can afford to.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you want to make a living with freelancing, you need to learn to get clients. And to get clients, you have to learn marketing and learn how to market well and smartly.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">My Golden Advice</h4>
<p class="mb-4">I always told myself that if I figured out how to make it as a freelancer, I would help others do the same. An here it is - in this question: Why do you choose to freelance?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Honestly, I don't want to freelance all the time for the rest of my life. For me, it's simple - to live the dotcom lifestyle.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Once you set your goal in place, things will become more clearer to you. Remember the old saying, "the rich don't work for money; they work for assets."</p>

<p class="mb-4">Your assets should be building your online audience, your community, your group - that's the secret! If you have 1 million active email addresses, you will never need to work that much. Just think about what you can do with a 1 million social media subscribers. You can sell anything! Start investing in those areas alongside your freelancing!</p>
