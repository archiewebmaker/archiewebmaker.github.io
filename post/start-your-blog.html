<p class="mb-4">You have to be a visionary. Create a vision board. Write it all down on a piece of paper.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Picture everything you want so clearly in your mind until you see it right in front of you.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You have to see it in your mind before you can see it in your reality.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you can see it in your mind, and if you can believe it in your heart.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you dare to speak it, and if you dare to own it. And the desire to work for it. </p>
<p class="mb-4">You can bring it to your reality.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There's nothing off-limits.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There are no limitations to those who believe and those who are willing to work for their dream.</p>

<h4>This post series will be your ultimate guide to starting a successful blog or taking your existing blog to the next level.</h4>

<p class="mb-4">The reason why the so-called "big multi-millionaire affiliate marketers" are absolutely terrified of this new disruption is because this amazing new "simple and practical" proven system - perfected in 20 years - allows you to <em>instantly</em> dominate the web, at the same time, it humiliate and expose their hoodwinking tips. No matter how new you are in the industry - you are an alpha from day one. You can learn it in 5 minutes, even if you're out-of-shape and have no previous blogging skills at all – <em>guaranteed!</em></p>

<p class="mb-4">Kidding aside, if you are serious about blogging, you need to read this post with the utmost seriousness and implement them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Remember that there are millions of blogs on the web all vying for readers’ time, and though you're not just another blogger, you are just another blogger in the bigger picture.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Success is no accident. Living a great Dotcom lifestyle will not come by luck or chance.</p>
<p class="mb-4">It won't fall from the sky.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There's no magic wand. There's no quick fix.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The good news is, there are principles that lead to success.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you commit to doing the things successful people do.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You will live a life of success and happiness.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Introducing to you - the Alpha's approach to blogging success.</p>

<h4>Your Idea Can Be The Next Big Thing</h4>

<p class="mb-4">Great ideas can come from anywhere and at any time. Would you believe that Colonel Sanders only started pitching his secret chicken recipe to restaurants at the age of 66, and with only $105 from his social security? Everyone thought he was senile, but our Colonel bravely charged into the battlefield of business and prevailed. Colonel Sanders was a great example that success is not dependent on how young you start or how much money you have to begin with. His inspirational quote:</p>
	
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
<p class="shadow p-3 rounded"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> I was sixty-six years old. I still had to make a living. I looked at my social security check of 105 dollars and decided to use that to try to franchise my chicken recipe. Folks had always liked my chicken. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

<h4>How To Present Your Ideas To The World?</h4>

<p class="mb-4"><strong><strong>Time-tested Secret To Success</strong></strong>: The secret is not in writing millions of posts, but in creating epic posts and then promoting and marketing those posts again and again until millions and millions read them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The fame and success of Robert Kiyosaki revolve around his book '<a href="https://amzn.to/32R6XK8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>.' Learn what he did: He <strong>branded</strong> himself around this book. You can see for yourself in his official website '<a href="https://www.richdad.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rich Dad</a>'. Wherever he goes, whatever he says, all his talks and seminars are based on this book.</p>

<figcaption class="text-center image-caption small">Robert Kiyosaki with wife Kim</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="mb-4">This book will make sales even after he is long gone. Today he is an internationally acclaimed American businessman, financial educator, and author. You can use this idea as your blogging strategy. Craft your own idea and start creating epic posts, then promote them again and again until the whole world hears about it.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This sounds simple and easy, right?</p>
<p class="mb-4">Have you ever wondered how successful people get to where they are in life? It looks so easy and effortless for them to have a good time, make friends, and influence people.</p>

<p class="mb-4">We see the glory, the splendid mansions, the adoring public, the wealthy lifestyle, and the endearing media coverage. However, many don't see the long arduous journeys they have taken. The pains, the tears, the struggles, and the desperation that some of them have crawled out of.</p>

<p class="mb-4">There are no shortcuts in blogging too.</p>

<h4>Stop Wasting Your Hosting Time</h4> 

<p class="mb-4">Stop listening to those affiliate marketers who want you to click on their referral link to start your blog right away.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">That's all they want. None of them is giving you the right advice.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If building a fully functional blog, one that generates income, is going to take months or even a year, why host your blog now?</p>

<p class="mb-4">The moment you pay for your hosting, the clock starts clicking nonstop for the next billing.</p>

<div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/clock-ticking.gif" alt="Hosting Clock Tower"></div>

<p class="mb-4">Why most amateur bloggers quit blogging is because they wasted so much time in building their blog (including SEO) after going online instead of marketing. So when the time comes for the next hosting bills, they had to decline because they made no money blogging. And they quit.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I just don't want you to make the same mistakes.</p>

<p class="mb-4">According to most affiliate marketers, starting a blog is almost the same as creating your email account or choosing a social username and then publishing posts on your Facebook page. The only difference is, this time, you got to pay for your hosting.</p>

<p class="mb-4">For those who don't have time listening, you can go for it. You can start your blog right away with the most recommended webhost: <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/rosefort/">Bluehost</a> - you get a free domain name. And best of luck!</p>



<h4>How To Start a Successful Blog?</h4>
<p class="mb-4">You can start by building your blog locally and completely from your computer.</p> 
<p class="mb-4">For example, if you are planning to sell courses on your blog, have all the course materials ready and get copywrited.</p> 
<p class="mb-4">Have all the bells and whistles, and when you're ready, export them to your blog online with a few clicks.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Don't waste your hosting time.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Do you know you can install WordPress blog for free on your computer? You can use it for building, customizing and testing purposes. </p>
<p class="mb-4">With this method you are taking your blog to the next level even before you start.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Why not take a milestone ahead, make yourself stand-out and be stronger even before you start.</p>
<p class="mb-4">And the best part - it gives you the freedom to start marketing and start selling right away from day one.</p>
<p class="mb-4">To really, really start a blog, here are the essential steps you can follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/post/build-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Build Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/brand-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Brand Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/host-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Host Your Blog</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">You don't need any coding skills to do this. You will be doing almost the same thing you used to do on your online blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Take a milestone ahead, start learning on how to monetize, socialize, market, and expose your blog even before you begin.</p>

<h4>You Can Make This Happen!</h4>

<ul>
<li>Brand Yourself, Brand Your Blog</li>
<li>Create epic posts</li>
<li>Build Your Community</li>
<li>Become a Disruptor*</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Disruptors</strong> are innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors. Disruption takes a left turn by literally uprooting and changing how we think, behave, do business, learn and go about our day-to-day.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen says that a disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative.</p>
