<p class="mb-4 py-4">In reality, nothing is secured, not even the so-called highest protected building in the world - the 'White House.'</p>
<p class="mb-4">What security is though is risk reduction, not risk elimination.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Fundamentally, security is not about perfectly secure systems. Such a thing might well be impractical, or impossible to find and/or maintain.</p>

<p class="mb-4">It's about employing all the appropriate controls available to you, within reason, that allow you to improve your overall posture reducing the odds of making yourself a target, subsequently getting hacked.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This post will go through some common forms of vulnerabilities, and the things you can do to help keep your WordPress blog secure.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This post is not the ultimate quick fix to your security concerns. If you have specific security concerns or doubts, you should discuss them with people whom you trust to have sufficient knowledge of computer security and WordPress.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This post is designed to equip you with the beginner to intermediate level knowledge necessary to administer a secure WordPress website. We're going to cover the most important items to focus on to ensure that your site and data stay secure. This will provide you with solid foundational WordPress security knowledge.</p>

<h4>Update Everything</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Every once in a while, a WordPress update will be released and accompanied by a disclaimer: "This is a critical security release." While such a disclaimer makes things crystal clear, it’s important to install every WordPress update as quickly as possible – even those that don’t tout their own importance.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This doesn't just apply to the core either. Installing plugin and theme updates promptly is just as important as installing core updates as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Many updates to themes, plugins, and the WordPress core are released to address significant security vulnerabilities. So the number one thing you must do to keep WordPress secure is to keep everything updated.</p>

<h4>Use a Unique Username and Secure Password</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Many potential vulnerabilities can be avoided with good security habits. A unique username and a strong password is an important aspect of this.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The goal with your password is to make it hard for other people to guess and hard for a brute force attack to succeed. Many automatic password generators are available that can be used to create secure passwords.</p>

<p class="mb-4">WordPress also features a password strength meter which is shown when changing your password in WordPress. Use this when changing your password to ensure its strength is adequate.</p>

<h4>File Permissions and the WordPress Directory Structure</h4>
<p class="mb-4">WordPress is a PHP application that runs on a web server. That means that it is a collection of PHP files along with images, HTML and javascript files and other resources. During the normal operation of WordPress, few files change on the website. In fact, for most requests, the only files that will change are log files which exist outside of a WordPress installation.</p>

<p class="mb-4">So in theory, to prevent hackers from modifying your PHP code and installing their own malicious code, you can improve security by simply making your PHP files unmodifiable. You can do this by placing restrictive file permissions on your website files. However, this comes with a very serious downside.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Restricting your file permissions forces you to manually upgrade your WordPress core, theme and plugin files.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This is a very labor intensive process. But this is something I would recommend you to do.</p>

<h4>Hide PHP Errors</h4>

<p class="mb-4">PHP has built-in debugging capabilities and you can display the error messages generated by PHP on the front-end of your site by adding define( 'WP_DEBUG', true); to your site's wp-config.php file. It's a really useful tool for theme and plugin developers. However, you should never display PHP errors on a public facing site.</p>

<p class="mb-4">In some cases, displaying PHP errors can provide information that a sophisticated hacker can use to compromise your site. The simple solution is to set WP_DEBUG to false. You can either add that bit code to your site's wp-config.php file manually or use a plugin to do the job.</p>

<h4>Use a Unique Database Table Prefix</h4>
<p class="mb-4">If a hacker identifies a security vulnerability that allows them to write information to your site database, the last piece of information they need to carry out the exploit is your database prefix. By default, WordPress uses wp_ to prefix all database tables. So an easy way to lock up your WordPress database a little more tightly is to change the prefix to something hackers are less likely to guess.</p>

<p class="mb-4">While you can change your database prefix manually, it is a bit complex, and if you get it wrong you’ll have a mess to clean up. Instead of doing that, just change your database prefix with a plugin in a matter of seconds.</p>

<h4>Prevent PHP Execution</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Some themes and plugins include features that allow users to upload files to your web server. These files are then used in a variety of ways, such as to display a user profile photo. However, this feature can be exploited to upload PHP files bearing a site-hijacking or defacing payload. Then, when WordPress accesses those files, the code is executed and your site is damaged or compromised.</p>

<p class="mb-4">So, what is the solution? Should you stop letting users upload photos or files? Of course not. Just prevent the execution of PHP code in every directory that doesn’t require that permission.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You can prevent PHP execution on a directory-by-directory basis. If your site is hosted on an Apache server, as is the case for most WordPress websites, then you can add an .htaccess file to each directory with the instructions <Files *.php>deny from all</Files> to lock down PHP execution in that particular directory.</p>

<p class="mb-4">On the other hand, if you aren't sure which directories to lock down or just don't want to have to lock down each directory manually, you can lock them all down in one fell swoop with a plugin.</p>

<h4>Securing wp-config.php</h4>
<p class="mb-4">You can move the wp-config.php file to the directory above your WordPress install. This means for a site installed in the root of your webspace, you can store wp-config.php outside the web-root folder.</p>
	
<p class="mb-4">Note that wp-config.php can be stored ONE directory level above the WordPress (where wp-includes resides) installation. Also, make sure that only you (and the web server) can read this file (it generally means a 400 or 440 permission).

If you use a server with .htaccess, you can put this in that file (at the very top) to deny access to anyone surfing for it:</p>
<pre>&lt;files wp-config.php&gt;<br />order allow,deny<br />deny from all<br />&lt;/files&gt;</pre>

<h4>Data Backups</h4>

<p class="mb-4">Back up your data regularly, including your MySQL databases.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Data integrity is critical for trusted backups. Encrypting the backup, keeping an independent record of MD5 hashes for each backup file, and/or placing backups on read-only media increases your confidence that your data has not been tampered with.</p>

<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>
<p class="mb-4">If your WordPress websites don’t mean very much to you, and you don’t mind the hassle of dealing with the fallout of a hacked site, then by all means, do absolutely nothing.</p>

<p class="mb-4">However, if you do value the effort you’ve put into building your WordPress website(s), then failing to harden WordPress and keep it secure over the long run is an unacceptable oversight.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The web is a better place for all of us when hackers and scam artists are kept at bay. You should still set up and configure a high-quality security plugin such as WordFence, Sucuri Security, iThemes Security, or JetPack Premium.</p>
