<p class="mb-4 py-4">The internet is full of great articles about blogging, including how to BUILD a successful blog. </p>
<p class="mb-4">Maybe this will become one of them, whatever.</p>
<p class="mb-4">However, this piece is different.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You'll see.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you have been harboring this wonderful desire to start a blog and make a living blogging, let me tell you this: </p>

<p class="mb-4 font-italic">This is the perfect time to decide not to start a blog, not now.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I want you to take that decision, seriously.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Stop listening to those affiliate marketers who wants you to host your blog right away by clicking through their referral links. Honestly, I got one too.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>I will tell you a proven method that's going to work like a charm and make all the difference.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-4">With this method, you can even start marketing and start selling right away from day one!</p>

<p class="mb-4">I wish someone had told me this method some ages ago. But glad I did learn the hard way. And I tell you today with a sigh - this is the road taken by few.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I assure you, whoever you are, wherever you are from, you will be blessed by following this road - it will make all the difference for you.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I give you my word.</p>

<p class="mb-4">So, I want you to relax. Take a deep breath, this is going to take a bit.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Do you know why your blog is not making money?</strong></p>

<p class="mb-4">You have 1000+ Facebook friends but most of them are not even liking or reading your blog? You are not alone <i class="fa fa-heart-o"></i>. Let's find it out together!</p>

<p class="mb-4">You got super excited, got hooked seeing other bloggers showing off their income reports.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">And most probably you heard an affiliate marketer telling you this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your blog today.</li>
<li>You will need to "nurture and water" your blog so that it grows both in content quality and readership.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">I am not saying they are wrong. What I am saying to you is - stop listening to their mumbo-jumbo and take action for yourself.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Plain and simple.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-4">What they are saying is something like this: "First, you need to host your blog (from my referral link), everything begins from there. But as you are stupid, you need to do a lot of hard-working."</p>

<p class="mb-4">Most bloggers start a blog, push out a few posts based on something that they love, slap on a few Google Ads and believe that they will get loads of traffic and earn bags and bags of money. Sorry to be such a spoiler but that's not how it works.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>What you need is a well-planned strategy or a system that works</strong>.</p>

<p class="mb-4">And why did you pay for your hosting account when you know it's going to take months to build a fully functional blog?</p>

<p class="mb-4">The moment you pay for your hosting, the clock starts clicking nonstop for the next billing.</p>
<div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/clock-ticking.gif" alt="Hosting Clock Tower"></div>

<p class="mb-4">Most amateur bloggers quit blogging because they wasted so much time in building their blog (including SEO) after going online instead of marketing. So when the time comes for the next hosting bills, they had to decline because they made no money blogging. And they quit.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I just don't want you to make the same mistake.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you want to make a living blogging and build a business around it, what you need is a blueprint with a well-planned materials, design and strategy.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Build your blog like you build a castle right from your computer locally. Only when your blog is ready with all the bells and whistles, host your blog, and go online.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Over 90% of the bloggers start their blog without a formal written 'about me' page. When a new visitor comes to a blog, the 'about me' page is where most people go. Most fail miserably to make use of this vital page or adds any value for their business. </p>

<p class="mb-4">You need to HAVE everything and set everything in order before you host your blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">To be more precise, here's an example: if you are planning to start a paid course on your blog, first, have the lessons ready before you host your blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">When I say 'have everything and set everything in order,' it includes your 'about me' page, your contents, lessons, guides, faqs, your social media page description and more. But most importantly, your copywrited contents (minimum 10-30) on which you will run your blog business. Got it?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Have you seen a fast food cafe open and the carpenters working on the furniture? Forget buying or eating there, will you walk into that cafe?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Do you know you can install WordPress locally on your computer? You can use it for building, customizing and testing purposes.</p>

<p class="mb-4">And here's the best tool to get you started.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Install the free xampp server to host a WordPress blog locally on your computer. And prepare all your works there. Once you finish them, you can easily export them from your local blog to your blog online. </p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">This method may take weeks but this is the fastest way to start a successful blog. You are taking a milestone ahead, making you stand out, making you stronger even before you start, and the best part - it gives you the freedom to start marketing and start selling right away from day one.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Take a look at my <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">homepage</a> for inspiration what your blog should look like before you host your blog. I am not just talking about the design alone, it includes all the contents in and out. You should at least have the basic contents, good design and a strategy before you start!</p>

<p class="mb-4">Once you have all the materials or contents, you need a <strong>good design</strong> and a <strong>solid strategy</strong> to create conversion and sales.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Depending on the type of blog you have, you can create a specific monetizing strategy. If you're building a finely niched blog, you shouldn’t focus on ads in the beginning.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You should focus on building a <strong>Brand</strong>.</p>

<p class="mb-4">When you build a brand, you start attracting readers.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Once you’ve built a loyal readership, you can start implementing your monetizing strategies. Your main target is to implement Sales Funnels. How does it work?</p>

<ul>
<li>You write posts that attract specific people who are your target audience.</li>
<li>They read your posts and sign up to a highly related offer to receive newsletters from you.</li>
<li>These people aren’t ready to buy yet, but are extremely engaged with your content.</li>
<li>They finally purchase your product.</li>
<li>They love it so much, that they become loyal customers and buy more products from you.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">Now imagine several people moving through this funnel.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This is the basic principle of how most Bloggers make money and what you need to aim for.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Google has been telling us for years to set up goals and funnels for free at Google Analytics. You probably missed this out because most affiliate marketers wouldn't tell you this.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I want you to check this video out, please don't skip. Remember, this is what most bloggers failed to do.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">You see, you need the right copy, design and strategy right from your homepage - product page - thank you page to drive sales.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Brand Your Blog</h4>
<p class="mb-4">What's the difference between a personal blog and a business blog? It's the branding.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you need a custom design for your blog, that's what I do since 2000.</p>

<p class="mb-4">But for the moment, you need to understand what is branding all about, why and how to brand your blog.</p>
