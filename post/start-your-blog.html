<p class="mb-4 py-4">Do you want to start a successful blog? Do you want to start selling right away from day one?</p> 

<p class="mb-4">STOP listening to those affiliate marketers who want you to click on their referral link to start your blog right away.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">That's all they want. None of them is giving you the right advice.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If building a blog is going to take months or even a year, why host your blog now?</p>

<p class="mb-4">The moment you pay for your hosting, the clock starts clicking nonstop for the next billing.</p>

<div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/clock-ticking.gif" alt="Hosting Clock Tower"></div>

<p class="mb-4">Why waste your hosting time?</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Why most amateur bloggers quit blogging is because they wasted so much time in building their blog (including SEO) after going online instead of marketing. So when the time comes for the next hosting bills, they had to decline because they made no money blogging. And they quit.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I just don't want you to make the same mistakes.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you are serious about blogging, you need to read this post with the utmost seriousness and implement them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">According to most affiliate marketers, starting a blog is almost the same as creating your email account or choosing a social username and then publishing posts on your Facebook page. The only difference is, this time, you got to pay for your hosting.</p>

<p class="mb-4">For those who don't have time listening, you can go for it. You can start your blog right away with the most recommended webhost: <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/rosefort/">Bluehost</a> - you get a free domain name. And best of luck!</p>

<p class="mb-4">The fame and success of Robert Kiyosaki revolve around his book '<a href="https://amzn.to/32R6XK8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>.' He is an internationally acclaimed American businessman, financial educator, and author. Wherever he goes, whatever he says, all his talks and seminars are based on this book. In other sense, you can change and impact the world with just one idea! Repeat them all over again and again until the whole world hears about it.</p>

<h3>Here are the four pillars for blogging success:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create epic posts fully copywrited</li>
<li>Brand Yourself, Brand Your Blog</li>
<li>Build Your Community</li>
<li>Become a Disruptor*</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Disruptors</strong> are innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors. Disruption takes a left turn by literally uprooting and changing how we think, behave, do business, learn and go about our day-to-day.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen says that a disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative.</p>

<h3>How To Make This Happen?</h3>

<p class="mb-4">You can start by building your blog locally and completely from your computer.</p> 
<p class="mb-4">For example, if you are planning to sell courses on your blog, have all the course materials ready and get copywrited.</p> 
<p class="mb-4">Have all the bells and whistles, and when you're ready, export them to your blog online with a few clicks.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Don't waste your hosting time.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Do you know you can install WordPress blog for free on your computer? You can use it for building, customizing and testing purposes. </p>
<p class="mb-4">With this method you are taking blog to the next level even before you start.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Why not take a milestone ahead, make yourself stand-out and stronger even before you start, and the best part - it gives you the freedom to start marketing and start selling right away from day one.</p>

<p class="mb-4">To really, really start a blog, here are the essential steps you can follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/post/build-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Build Your Blog</a> locally on your computer.</li>
<li><a href="/post/brand-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Brand Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/seo-your-blog.html" target="_blank">SEO Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/copywrite-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Copywrite Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/protect-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Protect Your Blog</a></li>
<li>Finally, <a href="/post/host-your-blog.html" target="_blank">host Your Blog</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">You don't need any coding skills to do this. You will be doing almost the same thing you used to do on your online blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Take a milestone ahead, start learning on how to monetize, socialize, market, and expose your blog even before you begin.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Success in blogging may not be a short-term possibility. The road to becoming a successful, financially independent blogger may be long and hard but the rewards of reaching your goal can be very satisfying!</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you can see it in your mind.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you can believe it in your heart.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you have the courage to speak it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you have the courage to own it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">And the desire to work for it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You can bring it to your reality.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There's nothing off limits.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There are no limitations to those who believe and those who are willing to work for their dream.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You have to see it in your mind before you can see it in your reality.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Picture everything you want so clearly in your mind, </p>
<p class="mb-4">Until you see it right infront of you. </p>
<p class="mb-4">Write it all down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Create a vision board.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You have to be a visionary.</p>
