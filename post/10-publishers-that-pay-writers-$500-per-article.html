<p class="mb-4 py-4">As a freelance writer, it can be a struggle to find high-quality paying work. It often seems like the only options available are $5-per-article scams and work from content mills, which can seem like good opportunities — until you check your bank account balance and realize it’ll take ages before your hard work adds up into real earnings.</p>

<p class="mb-4">While finding quality paying work is difficult, it isn’t impossible. In fact, there are lots of publications that will pay you a premium to write for them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">While there are probably tens of thousands of magazines that pay writers, a much smaller number compensate writers really well. The following is a list of publishers that pay writers $500 per article. Keep in mind that all of these publishers have very specific requirements.</p>
