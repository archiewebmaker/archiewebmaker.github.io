<p class="mb-4 py-4">The internet is full of great articles about branding, including how to brand your blog. </p>
<p class="mb-4">Maybe this will become one of them, whatever.</p>
<p class="mb-4">However, this piece is different.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You'll see.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Building a brand isn't about feeding your ego. It's about giving yourself more opportunities to help and connect with people in your industry.</p>

<p class="mb-4">What's the difference between a personal blog and a business blog? It's the branding.</p>

<p class="mb-4">While a business blog will become an extension of the brand itself, a personal blog will have no such direction to follow, at least in the beginning.</p>

<p class="mb-4">However, what's stopping you from taking an organized approach to building a long-lasting brand for your new personal blog?</p>


<p class="mb-4">A brand lets people know who you are and what you do. Readers new to your site will only stay if you make it easy. If they have to think then they’ll leave. If they’re confused they’ll leave.</p>

<p class="mb-4">By having a clear brand, readers will know what to expect. If they like what you do, they’ll stick around. They may even subscribe to your email list.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Does your brand stand out? Whether it's your domain name, logo, company colors, voice, look and feel, use of language, sounds or other attributes – does it make a strong impression?</p>

<p class="mb-4">This video is worth watching!</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">To ensure that your brand creates a lasting impression, you must be able to distinguish it from your competitive set in a way that’s meaningful and memorable to your customers.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">Your site's design is just as important as your brand voice.</p>

<p class="mb-4">One example of brand-related design done well is <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seth Godin</a>'s site.</p>

<p class="mb-4">He knows that people are there to hear from him, so he’s made himself quite literally the focus of his page.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You have to click his head to read his blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Once you get to his blog, he keeps things pretty simple.</p>

<p class="mb-4">That's what design should be all about – getting people to interact with you.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Design your blog's theme around your brand. That's it!</p>
