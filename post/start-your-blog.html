<p class="mb-4">The fame and success of Robert Kiyosaki revolve around his book '<a href="https://amzn.to/32R6XK8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>.' He is an internationally acclaimed American businessman, financial educator, and author. Wherever he goes, whatever he says, all his talks and seminars are based on this book.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You can use this idea as your blogging strategy. Create epic posts, let it go viral. If not, promote them again and again until the whole world hears about it.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">Do you want to start a successful blog? Do you want to start selling right away from day one?</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Then STOP listening to those affiliate marketers who want you to click on their referral link to start your blog right away.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">That's all they want. None of them is giving you the right advice.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If building a fully functional blog, one that generates income, is going to take months or even a year, why host your blog now?</p>

<p class="mb-4">The moment you pay for your hosting, the clock starts clicking nonstop for the next billing.</p>

<div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/clock-ticking.gif" alt="Hosting Clock Tower"></div>

<p class="mb-4">Why waste your hosting time?</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Why most amateur bloggers quit blogging is because they wasted so much time in building their blog (including SEO) after going online instead of marketing. So when the time comes for the next hosting bills, they had to decline because they made no money blogging. And they quit.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I just don't want you to make the same mistakes.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you are serious about blogging, you need to read this post with the utmost seriousness and implement them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">According to most affiliate marketers, starting a blog is almost the same as creating your email account or choosing a social username and then publishing posts on your Facebook page. The only difference is, this time, you got to pay for your hosting.</p>

<p class="mb-4">For those who don't have time listening, you can go for it. You can start your blog right away with the most recommended webhost: <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/rosefort/">Bluehost</a> - you get a free domain name. And best of luck!</p>

<h3>Your Niche, Audience and Goal</h3>
<p class="mb-4">To decide on your niche is no small task. As a general rule of thumb, choose a niche where you have some level of interest. This is a motivational factor that can make or break your blog. As long as you can maintain a consistent level of interest in a chosen subject area, you will be able to blog on it.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The next step is to define your audience in as broad terms as possible. For example, if you are an Adobe Premiere Pro fan and you want to blog on it — it might be a better choice to keep your blogging to the entire gambit of Video Editing.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Thus, you'll be able to maintain the interest level at the same time you have the option to choose from a range of topics. Additionally, your audience will not be just limited to Adobe Premiere Pro users.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Goal setting will help clarify and remove doubts about what the blog is supposed to do. Start with a plan and be ready to change it if things are not working out as expected.</p>

<h3>Here are the four pillars for blogging success:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create epic posts fully copywrited</li>
<li>Brand Yourself, Brand Your Blog</li>
<li>Build Your Community</li>
<li>Become a Disruptor*</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Disruptors</strong> are innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors. Disruption takes a left turn by literally uprooting and changing how we think, behave, do business, learn and go about our day-to-day.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen says that a disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative.</p>

<h3>How To Make This Happen?</h3>

<p class="mb-4">You can start by building your blog locally and completely from your computer.</p> 
<p class="mb-4">For example, if you are planning to sell courses on your blog, have all the course materials ready and get copywrited.</p> 
<p class="mb-4">Have all the bells and whistles, and when you're ready, export them to your blog online with a few clicks.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Don't waste your hosting time.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Do you know you can install WordPress blog for free on your computer? You can use it for building, customizing and testing purposes. </p>
<p class="mb-4">With this method you are taking your blog to the next level even before you start.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Why not take a milestone ahead, make yourself stand-out and be stronger even before you start.</p>
<p class="mb-4">And the best part - it gives you the freedom to start marketing and start selling right away from day one.</p>
<p class="mb-4">To really, really start a blog, here are the essential steps you can follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/post/build-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Build Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/brand-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Brand Your Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/host-your-blog.html" target="_blank">Host Your Blog</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">The reason why the big multi-millionaire affiliate marketers are absolutely terrified of this new disruption is because this amazing new "simple and practical" proven system - perfected in 20 years - allows you to <em>instantly</em> dominate the web, at the same time, it humiliate and expose their hoodwinking tips. No matter how new you are in the industry - you are an alpha from day one. You can learn it in 5 minutes, even if you're out-of-shape and have no previous blogging skills at all – <em>guaranteed!</em></p>

<p class="mb-4">You don't need any coding skills to do this. You will be doing almost the same thing you used to do on your online blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Take a milestone ahead, start learning on how to monetize, socialize, market, and expose your blog even before you begin.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you can see it in your mind.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you can believe it in your heart.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you have the courage to speak it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you have the courage to own it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">And the desire to work for it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You can bring it to your reality.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There's nothing off limits.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There are no limitations to those who believe and those who are willing to work for their dream.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You have to see it in your mind before you can see it in your reality.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Picture everything you want so clearly in your mind, </p>
<p class="mb-4">Until you see it right infront of you. </p>
<p class="mb-4">Write it all down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Create a vision board.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You have to be a visionary.</p>
