<p>When it comes to making decisions within your business, pricing yourself might be the most difficult. There’s so much confusion about what to charge, what’s too little, what’s too much, the list goes on and on. So let’s talk about it!</p>
				    
<p>You need to pay close attention to pricing. Here is a short story about two freelance bloggers, enjoy and learn a few lessons!</p>

<p>Not so long ago, in a buzzing little town of Redactonburg, there lived two twins. They went to the same school and the same college. They have the same set of skills, and both became freelance bloggers. Both worked hard.</p>

<p>Both worked hard. The first blogger worked every day, whereas the second blogger worked weekly. The first blogger got ten clients a month, and the second blogger got two clients a month.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the second blogger earned much more than the first blogger. "How can this be?" </p>

<p>The secret is in the pricing!</p>

<p>The first blogger charged $10 per post, whereas the second blogger charged $100 per post. The first blogger might have thought that charging low will enable him to get more clients. He did but less pay and more works! </p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why this story?</h3>
<p>My goal with this storys is to share with you some of the changes I made in how I priced myself. These changes helped me earn more income in less time. If you implement these changes then they can help you do the same.</p>

<p>With pricing, it’s not just about the money. It’s about quality of life. As you see in my example, I still made the same income. I simply worked less hours, which gave me more time to enjoy life, to write and create meaningful things.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Hourly Pricing</h3>
<p>After 10 years of web design project, I realized that I was doing myself a serious injustice by billing hourly. Clients don’t care if it takes you 20 minutes or 20 hours to complete the project. Clients care that the work is done and it is done well.</p>

<p>When you charge based on the project, you are tying the price of the project to the client’s end result. The end result is all that the client cares about.</p>

<p>Project-based fees helped increase my income while working far less time. But the bigger question is: How do you come up with a price point for these projects?</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">So, How Much Should You Charge?</h3>
<p>How do you come up with a price point that the client will buy and will increase your income? The truth is much simpler than you think. It comes down to one simple method to determine your pricing.</p>

<p>Make it up. Yes – make it up! Make up your pricing for every client. There is no formula, no rules, and no perfect way to do it.</p>
<p>However, I'll never work for something less than $100, but that's just me.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Understand Your Clients</h3><br>
<p>Talk to your potential client and first try to understand them, their problems and their wants.</p>

<p>If you can emphasize the value that you provide to the client in your proposal process, then you will begin to see your income grow as a result of it.</p>

<p>For example: You are doing a website design or branding project for a client, then you are providing them significant value. You are helping them improve their online presence and you are improving their brand perception. This will help them drive more sales and increase the income of their business.</p>

<p>If you can emphasize the value that you provide to the client in your proposal process, then you will begin to see your income grow as a result of it. Happy freelancing!</p>
