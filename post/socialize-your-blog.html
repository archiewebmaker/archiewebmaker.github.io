<p class="mb-4 py-4">There was a time when there were many advantages of blog comments. But ever since blog commenting became popular as a method for building links and referral traffic, shady SEO professionals have abused them by posting spammy comments full of backlinks.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Moderating hundreds of spammy comments a day, despite using anti-spam plugins, has become a reality for many popular bloggers.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you don't own a popular blog, it's likely that your blog gets very few comments. Maintaining a comments section in the hope that you'll get a few real comments, while having to clean up hundreds of spammy comments a day may not be a good way to spend your time.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Even when we read a blog post nowadays, a large number of us prefer to comment about it or share about it on social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p class="mb-4">So, if social media has taken over the conversation around your blog content, how do you keep up with it? Take your blog to the social media. Get more active on your social profiles. Share your blog posts on all your profiles and engage with the readers who leave comments, so that they don't feel neglected or ignored.</p>

<p class="mb-4 ">You don't need to be present on every single social networking site out there, but you do need to have content to share. As you build your readership and expand your presence to other social outlets, try what works best for you one by one and enjoy the new relationships that come from it.</p>

<h4>Build Your Community</h4>
<p class="mb-4">The time to start building a community is now. Without a community you're going to struggle to gain momentum.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I am not just going to tell you to start your own YouTube channel, Facebook group and page (Of course, that's what you must do). I know it's hard to gain followers and subscribers.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Do this first. Approach an influencer in your city. Do something valuable with them for free. Maybe even a guest post. They will surely allow you to introduce yourself and drop a few links.</p>

<h4>Create Awesome Content</h4>
<p class="mb-4">There is so much content already on the internet, and still so much that is yet to be created. When planning content for your brand, think hard about how to be different. Don’t just try to spin an article that already exists – give your own opinion on an issue that’s unlike anything else out there.  Pride yourself on being unique, and providing an intellectual hub.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If that's not exactly in line with your branding, why not try to stand out by being funny or interesting? As long as you make an effort to be different, visitors will take note and be more willing to comment or share. Your efforts will stand out amongst the sea of the same and content pushed out solely for SEO benefits, with no nod to the human’s supposedly reading it.</p>

<h4>Build Reputation</h4>
<p class="mb-4">As with most things these days, you need to have some reputation to make a mark. And that reputation needs to be built. The easy way to build your reputation is by becoming an expert in any particular area that you are especially interested in. This is easy.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Choose any topic of interest and research it on the Internet for six months and you will know more about it than most people.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Reputation as a consistent blogger with an informed and well-articulated point of view will more or less guarantee a loyal group of frequent readers. You also need good rep to ensure that what you say is 'bought' by your readers. Otherwise, you’re just another chap with a big mouth.</p>

<h4>Social Sharing Buttons</h4>
<p class="mb-4">The easiest way to get people to share your company’s content is by making sure that every article has easy to use social sharing buttons.</p>

<p class="mb-4">These buttons make it easy to share content on any network, and should ideally include the ability to email articles for the older generation that is uncomfortable with social media but still wants to share.</p>

<p class="mb-4">An important feature of social share buttons that shouldn't be overlooked is the ability to add a Twitter handle or hashtag automatically with article shares for tracking purposes (and to get new followers).</p>

<p class="mb-4">A couple examples of useful social sharing buttons that easily integrate with a CMS like WordPress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digg Digg</li>
<li>ShareThis</li>
<li>Socialize</li>
</ul>

<h4>Engage with Your Visitors</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Engage with your website visitors and get more leads by installing live chat widget or AI bot.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You can also chat with website visitors via popular messaging apps. Try <a href="https://getbutton.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Getbutton</a>, No coding required. For free.</p>


<p class="mb-4">The most important takeaway when trying to socialize your website is to try to understand your audience and consider what they care about.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Put yourself in the visitor’s shoes: does your website make sense? Do you want to interact with content? Would you be willing to share it with someone else in the industry?</p>
