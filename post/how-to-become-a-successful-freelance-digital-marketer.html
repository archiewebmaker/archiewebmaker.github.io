<p class="mb-4 py-4">We are quickly becoming a world of permanent freelancers. Traditionally, being self-employed used to come with a social stigma; you were self-employed if you couldn’t get a "real job." Work was inconsistent and so was the pay. Today, the opportunities for contingent, project-based work are exploding, as is the development of tools that allow people to work independently across industries like software, design, marketing, legal services, architecture, healthcare, and engineering.</p>
				    
<p class="mb-4">The increasing hyper connectivity of the digital world has broken down both physical and geographical barriers in many industries, meaning that people can produce work and remain productive wherever they are in the world, at any time. And digital marketing is no exception.</p>

<p class="mb-4">By 2020, more than 40% of the US workforce will be so-called contingent workers, according to a study conducted by software company Intuit in 2010. The fastest-growing segment of freelancers is those making $75,000 and up, with over a third in that category. With so many avenues and angles to explore, a constant rate of evolution, and a growing number of touch points to exploit, more and more businesses are looking to freelance digital marketing specialists to help them deliver important campaigns and projects.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Becoming a digital marketing freelancer is a potentially lucrative, rewarding, and entirely flexible situation and if you feel it’s the venture for you. Digital marketing is one of the best jobs to earn money and travel the world with and encompasses a variety of skills such as advertising, social media, blogging, SEO, content marketing and more. So how do you become a digital marketer and make that digital nomad dream come true? Here are some tips on how to make it happen.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Change your mindset</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Stop thinking like a normal person and start thinking like an entrepreneur. These mindset components are not rigid. They are elastic and subjective. As part of the ongoing study of the entrepreneurial mindset, and based on our experience, we have been able to break it down into eight key parts - specific ways entrepreneurs think about and approach things: Opportunity recognition, Comfort with risk, Creativity and innovation, Future orientation, Flexibility and adaptability, Initiative and self-direction, Critical thinking and problem solving, Communication and collaboration.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Develop your skillset</h4>
<p class="mb-4">According to a recent digital study, around 50% of modern businesses are suffering from a shortage of skilled workers. There is currently a digital skills gap, and if you can fill it, you will find your pick of the best freelance roles, assignments, contracts and projects in your field.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Build your portfolio</h4>
<p class="mb-4">As a freelance digital marketer, a CV alone isn't likely to land you the calibre of clients that will provide you with a successful, sustainable career - you will also need to build up a portfolio of work that you can showcase to your prospects. When filling out or updating your portfolio, make sure you include a professional profile shot of yourself and include a synopsis as well as real client testimonials to accompany each link to, or image of, your work.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Learn Copywriting</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Copywriting is the art of using sales copy to persuade readers to become buyers. Digital media is driven by content. You will not escape writing content. Good copywriting skill is something you must develop if you want to run a successful freelance digital marketing business. You have to be able to use words to tell a brand’s story and be able to convince people to take an action that leads to sales.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Learn to pitch</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Every time you branch out to a prospective client, you will be going up against a host of other freelance competition, so learning how to pitch your services or ideas is essential to success.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Add value to your service</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Adding value to a product or service helps companies attract more customers, which can boost revenue. Remember, if everyone is offering the same thing, these factors of the product or service become the basic minimum, or the expected norm in the market. If you want to stand out as a person or as a producer, you have to "plus" whatever you are doing so that your customer perceives you and your offering as being superior to that of your competitors.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Tap into the gig economy</h4>
<p class="mb-4">By finding the right professional work-based platforms and sites for your niche, optimizing your profiles on said platforms and actively participating, you will stand an excellent chance of picking up regular freelance digital marketing work.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Get inbound</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Rather than pitch out for freelance work all of the time, by creating an engaging, mobile-friendly, fully-optimized website, as well as a relevant social media channels, and honing your inbound or content marketing skills, you will enhance your online presence, boost awareness and ultimately have clients queing up to use your services.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Reputation</h4>
<p class="mb-4">As with most things these days, you need to have some reputation to make a mark. And that reputation needs to be built. The easy way to build your reputation is by becoming an expert in any particular area that you are especially interested in. This is easy. Choose any topic of interest and research it on the Internet for six months and you will know more about it than most people. Reputation as a consistent blogger with an informed and well-articulated point of view will more or less guarantee a loyal group of frequent readers. You also need good rep to ensure that what you say is 'bought' by your readers. Otherwise, you’re just another chap with a big mouth.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Finally, do not give up your day job just yet. Success in Freelance Digital Marketing is not a short-term possibility. You will need to "nurture and water" your skills and activities so that it grows both in quality and readership. A formal written objective will help keep you focused on the task and enable you to benchmark yourself for success. Pay attention to what is happening and analyze the reasons for success so that you can build on it as well as the reasons for failure so that you can take corrective action. The road to becoming a successful, financially independent marketer may be long and hard but the rewards of reaching your goal can be very satisfying!</p>
