<p class="mb-4">I wish someone had told me this some ages ago. But glad I did learn the hard way. And I tell you today with a sigh - this is the road taken by few.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I assure you, whoever you are, wherever you are from, you will be blessed by following this road - it will make all the difference for you.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I give you my word.</p>

<p class="mb-4">So, I want you to relax. Take a deep breath, this is going to take a bit.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Be Prepared</h4>
<p class="mb-4">If you have been harboring this wonderful desire to start a blog and make a living blogging, let me tell you this: </p>

<p class="mb-4 font-italic">This is the perfect time to decide not to start a blog, not now.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I want you to take that decision, seriously.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Stop listening to those affiliate marketers who wants you to host your blog right away by clicking through their referral links. Honestly, I got one too.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you want to make a living blogging and build a business around it, what you need is a blueprint with a well-planned materials, design and strategy.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You need to HAVE everything and set everything in order before you host your blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">To be more precise, here's an example: if you are planning to start a paid course on your blog, at least have the lessons ready before you host your blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Once you registered your domain  name and hosted your blog, the clock has begun ticking nonstop for the next billing.</strong></p>
<p class="mb-4">Google has been telling for more than a decade to set up goals and funnels for your business for free. You probably missed this out because most affiliate marketers wouldn't tell you this.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Once anyone grabs this idea, they will not start or host their blog right away without building it first. What this "goal setting and funnel" idea tells you is that it is a serious business. </p>

<p class="mb-4">You need materials, design and strategy in hand before you begin. Remember, this is what most bloggers failed to do. I want you to check this video out, please don't skip.</p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">You see, you need materials, design and strategy right from your homepage to you product page and to your thank you page.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Have you seen a fast food cafe open and the carpenters working on the furniture? Forget buying or eating there, will you walk into that cafe?</p>

<p class="mb-4">When I say 'have everything and set everything in order,' it includes your blog design, 'about me' page, your original posts, lessons, guides, faqs, your social media page description and more. But most importantly, your original posts (minimum 10-30) on which you will run your blog business. Got it?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Why most amateur bloggers quit blogging is because they wasted so much time in building their blog (including SEO) after going online instead of marketing. So when the time comes for the next billing, they had to decline because they made no money blogging. And they quit.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I just don't want you to make the same mistakes.</p>

<p class="mb-4">This method may take months but you are taking a milestone ahead, making you stand out, making you stronger even before you start, and the best part - it gives you the freedom to start marketing and start selling right away from day one.</p>

<p class="mb-4">And here's the best tool to get you started.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Install the free xampp server to host a WordPress blog locally on your computer. And prepare all your works there. Once you finish them, you can easily export them from your local computer to your host online. </p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">Here's an example for inspiration what your blog should look like before you host your blog online. I am not just talking about the design, it includes all the contents in and out. You should at least have the basic contents before you start!</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Few Tips To Consider Before You Start</h4>
<p class="mb-4">A professional blogger is someone that makes their living blogging. Whether they monetize their blog through ads, products, coaching, or some other paid offering, blogging is their full-time job.</p>

<p class="mb-4">So what does it really take to make it big in the blog world, and, for that matter, the Web world as well? Of course there isn't some instant mantra that you can follow to get blogging success, but by following these simple tips, you can make your mark.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Embrace The Reality</h4>
<p class="mb-4">At the beginning, it is quite likely that the only person who visits your blog is you. Things are usually slow when it comes to visitors on blogs. Remember that there are millions of blogs on the web all vying for readers’ time, and though you’re not just another blogger, you are just another blogger in the bigger picture.</p>

<p class="mb-4">To build a loyal reader base you need to be persevering enough to go a long time with a very few set of visitors. But perseverance does pay and will pay in the long run. Be persistent and consistent and you will see the results soon enough.</p>


<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Your Niche, Audience and Goal</h4>
<p class="mb-4">To decide on your niche is no small task. As a general rule of thumb, choose a niche where you have some level of interest. This is a motivational factor that can make or break your blog. As long as you can maintain a consistent level of interest in a chosen subject area, you will be able to blog on it.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The next step is to define your audience in as broad terms as possible. For example, if you are an Adobe Premiere Pro fan and you want to blog on it — it might be a better choice to keep your blogging to the entire gambit of Video Editing.</p> 


<p class="mb-4">Thus, you'll be able to maintain the interest level at the same time you have the option to choose from a range of topics. Additionally, your audience will not be just limited to Adobe Premiere Pro users.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Goal setting will help clarify and remove doubts about what the blog is supposed to do. Start with a plan and be ready to change it if things are not working out as expected.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Brand Your Blog</h4>
<p class="mb-4">What's the difference between a personal blog and a business blog? It's the branding. 

<p class="mb-4">While a business blog will become an extension of the brand itself, a personal blog will have no such direction to follow, at least in the beginning.</p>

<p class="mb-4">However, what's stopping you from taking an organized approach to building a long-lasting brand for your new personal blog?</p>


<p class="mb-4">A brand lets people know who you are and what you do. Readers new to your site will only stay if you make it easy. If they have to think then they’ll leave. If they’re confused they’ll leave. By having a clear brand, readers will know what to expect. If they like what you do, they’ll stick around. They may even subscribe to your email list.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Does your brand stand out? Whether it's your logo, company colors, voice, look and feel, use of language, sounds or other attributes – does it make a strong impression?</p>

<p class="mb-4">To ensure that your brand creates a lasting impression, you must be able to distinguish it from your competitive set in a way that’s meaningful and memorable to your customers.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Build Reputation</h4>
<p class="mb-4">As with most things these days, you need to have some reputation to make a mark. And that reputation needs to be built. The easy way to build your reputation is by becoming an expert in any particular area that you are especially interested in. This is easy.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Choose any topic of interest and research it on the Internet for six months and you will know more about it than most people.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Reputation as a consistent blogger with an informed and well-articulated point of view will more or less guarantee a loyal group of frequent readers. You also need good rep to ensure that what you say is 'bought' by your readers. Otherwise, you’re just another chap with a big mouth.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Build Your Community</h4>
<p class="mb-4">The time to start building a community is now. Without a community you're going to struggle to gain momentum.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I am not just going to tell you to start your own YouTube channel, Facebook group and page (Of course, that's what you must do). I know it's hard to gain followers and subscribers. Do this first. Approach an influencer in your city. Do something valuable with them for free. Maybe even a guest post. They will surely allow you to introduce yourself and drop a few links.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Blog Comments</h4>
<p class="mb-4">There was a time when there were many advantages of blog comments. But ever since blog commenting became popular as a method for building links and referral traffic, shady SEO professionals have abused them by posting spammy comments full of backlinks. Moderating hundreds of spammy comments a day, despite using anti-spam plugins, has become a reality for many popular bloggers.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you don't own a popular blog, it's likely that your blog gets very few comments. Maintaining a comments section in the hope that you'll get a few real comments, while having to clean up hundreds of spammy comments a day may not be a good way to spend your time.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Even when we read a blog post nowadays, a large number of us prefer to comment about it or share about it on social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. So, if social media has taken over the conversation around your blog content, how do you keep up with it? Take your blog to the social media. Get more active on your social profiles. Share your blog posts on all your profiles and engage with the readers who leave comments, so that they don't feel neglected or ignored.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Craft Epic Posts</h4>
<p class="mb-4">With blogging, you have to be regular. This is not to say that you should think of it as a daily chore, but more that you need to have at least some schedule of regularity in your updates.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You may choose to write every day, or you may choose to write once or twice a week. Whatever the regularity you decide, stick to it. It is the only way you can try and ensure regular visitors at your blog. Choose a regularity that you are sure you can keep.</p>

<p class="mb-4">However, the secret is not in writing many posts, but in promoting and marketing your epic posts again and again until millions and millions read them.</p>

<p class="lead shadow p-3 mb-4 bg-white rounded">The internet is a highly fluid and dynamic environment. You have to be on your toes to find out the latest opportunity. </p>

<p class="mb-4">Success in blogging is not a short-term possibility. You will need to "nurture and water" your blog so that it grows both in content quality and readership. A formal written objective will help keep you focused on the task and enable you to benchmark yourself for success. Pay attention to what is happening and analyze the reasons for success so that you can build on it as well as the reasons for failure so that you can take corrective action. The road to becoming a successful, financially independent blogger is long and hard but the rewards of reaching your goal can be very satisfying!</p>
