<p class="mb-4 py-4">The internet is full of great articles about branding, including how to brand your blog. </p>
<p class="mb-4">Maybe this will become one of them, whatever.</p>
<p class="mb-4">However, this piece is different.</p>
<p class="mb-4">You'll see.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Most people determine whether to stay on or leave a site in the first few seconds. If you want your blog's visitors to stay for longer and read your content, you need your site to leave a great first impression. Your site needs to look elegant, be easy to navigate, and show off useful and informative content.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Creating a branded website or blog can be the best thing you do for your business.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Building a brand isn't about feeding your ego. It's about giving yourself more opportunities to help and connect with people in your industry.</p>

<p class="mb-4">A brand lets people know who you are and what you do. Readers new to your site will only stay if you make it easy. If they have to think then they’ll leave. If they’re confused they’ll leave.</p>

<p class="mb-4">What's the difference between a personal blog and a business blog? <strong>It's the branding.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-4">Every company needs a website, but the really successful sites are usually well branded.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Make no mistake about it: a recognizable and loved brand is one of the most valuable assets a company owns.</p>

<p class="mb-4">According to a Nielson survey, 59% of consumers prefer to buy new products from brands familiar to them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">In an ideal world, a visitor lands on your brand’s website. He finds it legit and gets impressed by the unique yet simple design of the website. He makes a quick decision to buy from your brand and goes on recommending it to his friends and family.</p>

<p class="mb-4">To make this happen in the real world, we need to put lots of effort and care into brand building with your website design.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Infusing branding strategies into the web design will indeed help develop trust among the users, <strong>but the question arises on how to nail this task?</strong></p>

<p class="mb-4">Your site's design is just as important as your brand voice.</p>

<p class="mb-4">One example of brand-related design done well is <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seth Godin</a>'s site.</p>

<p class="mb-4">He knows that people are there to hear from him, so he’s made himself quite literally the focus of his page.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You have to click his head to read his blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Once you get to his blog, he keeps things pretty simple.</p>

<p class="mb-4">That's what design should be all about – getting people to interact with you.</p>

<p class="mb-4">While a business blog will become an extension of the brand itself, a personal blog will have no such direction to follow, at least in the beginning.</p>

<p class="mb-4">However, what's stopping you from taking an organized approach to building a long-lasting brand for your blog?</p>

<p class="mb-4">By having a clear branded blog, readers will know what to expect. If they like what you do, they’ll stick around. They may even subscribe to your email list.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Does your brand stand out? Whether it's your domain name, logo, company colors, voice, look and feel, use of language, sounds or other attributes – does it make a strong impression?</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>To ensure that your brand creates a lasting impression, you must be able to distinguish it from your competitive set in a way that’s meaningful and memorable to your customers.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-4 py-4">From the people's view, you are always a brand, whether you think you have one or not. And your website design speaks volumes about your brand.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Branding can be broken down into three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand Strategy</li>
<li>Brand Identity</li>
<li>Brand Marketing</li>
</ul>
	
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Brand Strategy</strong> will map out how you are different, trustworthy, memorable and likable by your ideal customer. It will convey your purpose, promises, and how you solve problems for people.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Brand Identity</strong> is the way that you convey this to the public with visuals, messaging, and experience. Your brand strategy will influence how you present your identity and align it with your purpose for the most impact.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Brand Marketing</strong> is the way that businesses or organizations highlight and bring awareness to products or services by connecting values and voice to the right audience through strategic communication.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Here come the tips: The best way is to design your blog around your brand that reflects your logo and identity.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The main reason brands are developed is to help build trust among the customers. Achieving the same via your website design is not very difficult.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>A point to be noted</strong>: Color psychology is definitely not a myth, and marketers and advertisers have been using it to evoke the feelings in us, which they intend for a brand's recognition.</p>

<p class="mb-4">For instance, the color green is calm and represents health and nature. It is used by healthcare and environment-friendly brands. Blue depicts intelligence and responsibility, and numerous corporate brands use this color very frequently in all aspects to encourage client trust.</p>
