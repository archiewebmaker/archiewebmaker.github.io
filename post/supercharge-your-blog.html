<p class="mb-4">And many consumers who buy premium or luxury goods are not in a financial position to be able to afford such goods.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WP Mail SMTP</a> is a free WordPress email SMTP plugin. It allows you to send emails to your subscribers easily. You can integrate it with the email subscription and marketing services to promote your blog.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Why you need it</strong>: Have you ever had issues with WordPress not sending emails when someone fills out your contact form, or if you try to reset your password? That's because, by default, WordPress isn’t set up for reliable email deliverability.</p>

<h4>Contact Form 7</h4>
<p class="mb-4"><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contact Form 7</a> can manage multiple contact forms, plus you can customize the form and the mail contents flexibly with simple markup. The form supports Ajax-powered submitting, CAPTCHA, Akismet spam filtering and so on.</p>

<p class="mb-4">When a visitor goes to your contact page on your website, they will need to fill out the form. Once they have filled out the form fields, they will click the button to submit. Once submitted, the information in the fields will automatically be sent via email to you.</p>

<h4>Akismet Anti-Spam</h4>
