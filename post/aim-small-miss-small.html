<p><i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> <strong>Why this post?</strong> I stumbled upon a post so ignorant about this beautiful quote. This blogger tried to dismiss this awesome advice with a rhetoric, "Life is too short to aim small." This quote, "Aim Small, Miss Small" is not about having small aim in life - it's about target and strategy. And this piece of advice is very much applicable to business and marketing. That's why we have targeted advertising!</p>

<p>In the movie "The Patriot," there is a scene where Mel Gibson’s character is teaching a couple young boys how to shoot. He famously says "Aim small, miss small" meaning that if you aim at a man and miss, you miss the man, while if you aim at a button (for instance) and miss, you still hit the man. If you focus your aim on a small part of your target, you have a better chance of hitting it.</p>

<p>When you close your eyes, you rarely hit the target. But that's the way many of us live life – with our eyes closed – at least in terms of where we're headed and what we're aiming for.</p>

<p>If you don't narrow your focus, you may attempt to attract and serve everyone. By attempting to attract everyone you will also compete with everyone. Imagine the awfulness of trying to please everyone. Imagine the cost of competing against everyone.</p>

<p>A common mistake when making products is to aim too big. Product developers target "People who sell stuff online" "WordPress site owners" or "stay at home moms." Aiming big tends to miss big.</p>

<p>Successful businesses have mastered the discipline of aiming at a small, yet rich, target.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Here are three questions that will help your business Aim Small, Miss Small.</h3>
<ul>
<li>What does your business bring to the market that no one else can?</li>
<li>What makes your business unique and different?</li>
<li>What difference do you make in the lives of your customer or community?</li>
</ul>

<p>By answering these questions, you can begin to identify the narrow focus of your business.</p>

<p>Build your business on what you do best and that also has the biggest positive impact on your customers and community.</p>

<p>If you aim small, focus on what you can do based on the resources in front of you and provide a scheduled timetable in which to accomplish it. Then you will miss small.</p>

<p>The more detailed your game plan is, the better your chances are of achieving success. It will become the road map that you and your team will use to ask the right questions, evaluate progress and delegate responsibilities.</p>

<p>Whether you are a business leader, a pastor, an executive director, or sales manager, I encourage you to take time to define your target. Think as if you are playing the game... If darts are your people, resources, and content, what are you throwing them towards? Clarify the core of that target and make it known. Then, do everything you can to encourage everyone in your organization to aim small and miss small at that particular target. Not only will this increase the focus in which you do what you do, but it will also give clarity to why you do it and what kind of impact you were actually making.</p>
