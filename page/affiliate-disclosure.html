<p class="mb-4">As a website owner, I'm required by law to comply various guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising.</p>

<p class="mb-4">On a more personal note, I believe that being transparent with my audience is the right thing to do. That’s why I’m creating this disclosure page to let you know that I do make money from this website.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> If you’re using this website, then you should know:</p>  
<ul>
<li>I get direct benefit from every post and page I put on this website. Whether that is monetary or simple joy of helping others, I’m benefiting from it.</li>
<li>I do not have a direct association with the products that are promoted on this site.</li>
<li>If you see an external link with a prefix /track/referer/refer/, then it is an affiliate link. What that means is if you click on that link and purchase a product, then at no additional cost to you, I will receive an a small referral commission.</li>
<li>I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</li>
<li>I do write about my own products and websites, so yes that means those projects get additional PR and exposure.</li>
<li>I run my own consulting company, so it is possible that this blog may help me land new clients. </li>
<li>I make a lot of friends thanks to social media and business travel.</li>
<li>I do get a lot of freebies that I test and review. Often vendors send me those freebies in exchange for a review. However that doesn’t mean that they get a positive review. If I don’t like the product, then I will slam them. That’s just the way I roll.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">It’s important that I emphasize that the words on this website are mine and are not influenced by any sort of compensation. I only recommend products or services that I use personally and/or believe will add value to my readers.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you have any question regarding the above, then please do not hesitate to contact me by using the contact page.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Truly, <br/> Archie Webmaker</p>
