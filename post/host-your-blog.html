<p class="mb-4">Still have a few questions about choosing the best blog host? Before we finish up, I’ll tackle some of the most common questions about hosting.</p> 

<h3 class="mb-4">What is a free hosted blog?</h3>

<p class="mb-4">Free blog hosting are the ones that most people turn to when they want to give blogging a try. Common ones include Blogger, Tumblr, and more. You sign up for a free account and then can start blogging.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Sounds great, right?</p>

<p class="mb-4">Not so fast. Let’s take a closer look…</p>

<p class="mb-4">These blogs are nice if you are early on in your blogging career and want something that is free and easy to use. Tumblr especially has other advantages like being able to re-blog other people's posts.</p>

<p class="mb-4">If you want to grow a blog or a website to make money or grow a business, then you need your own domain name and self-hosted blog.</p> 

<ul>
<li>Most <strong>free</strong> blogs don't allow you to add new features to your site like online stores, forums, membership features, and more. Sometimes they do offer advanced features, but they have expensive monthly fees.</li>
<li>The biggest <strong>drawback </strong>for us is that you don't really own your blog – the provider does. Why would you want to spend years building up an asset that you don't fully own or control?</li>
<li>It's well known that <strong>Google</strong> doesn't give as much weight to free blogs on their search results. Why? Because they don’t consider them as authoritative. By hosting your own blog with your own domain name, you're signalling to Google that you mean business.</li>
<li>On a self-hosted blog you can upload your own themes, hire designers to create a custom theme, and more. You can tweak the layout and change the total look and feel. With a free blog you often can’t. You are normally stuck with whatever the free blog host offers, which means that your blog will look like a lot of others.</li>
<li><strong>Bad for branding</strong>. Something a lot of people don't realize is how important it is to have your own domain name. This is very important for building up your brand over the years.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">That being said, there are a lot of bloggers out there who love their free host. And while we don’t think they’re the optimal solution, we do admit that they’re fine if you’re blogging as a hobby.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I hope you found our hosting guide useful. If you’ve chosen a host and you’re looking to set up your blog for the first time, you’ll definitely want to check out our ultimate guide to <a href="/post/start-your-blog.html">starting a blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
<p class="shadow p-3 rounded"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> <strong>Why branding is so important?</strong> Branding is important because not only is it what makes a memorable impression on consumers but it allows your customers and clients to know what to expect from your company. It is a way of distinguishing yourself from the competitors and clarifying what it is you offer that makes you the better choice. Do you want to brand your website or blog? That's what <a href="/page/contact.html"><strong>we do</strong></a> since 2000. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
